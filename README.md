# cointosses
An R package designed to simulate coin tosses or any bernoulli trial and analyze the outcome. I created this package because as boring as flipping a coin may seem, so many interesting topics can be illustrated using coins. This is also sort of a practice package that I use to try out new ideas.

### installation
```
install.packages('devtools')    
devtools::install_github("jstrat1618/cointosses")
```
